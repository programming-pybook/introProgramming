    "\n",
    "* Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements,\n",
    "which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you\n",
    "make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "* Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time\n",
    "and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "* Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and\n",
