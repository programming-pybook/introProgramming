    "In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) chapter, we mentioned the two main stages considered in a data science project. In this notebook, we will extend this workflow by adding a new stage, namely the *data preparation* stage. **Data preparation** is a critical stage within the data analysis process given that data should be structure in such a way that it eases the extraction of information and does not alter the expected results. It is required because there might be missing values, missing variables<sup>1</sup> that must be computed based on existing features, discrepancies in the levels of categorical variables, wrong data formats, erroneous observations, to name but a few. Thus, when analyzing data, we consider the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preparation:** raw data is manipulated and transformed so further analysis can be performed atop of it to solve a domain problem.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory data analysis:** assumptions are verified, methods are chosen, and quality hypotheses are formulated.\n",
    "3. **Confirmatory data analysis:** (statistical hypothesis testing) previously defined hypotheses are tested and conclusions are drawn from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we placed *data preparation* as the first stage of the data analysis process, it is common that after performing the EDA, data scientists go back to the underlying data and prepare it even further. This is natural after identifying irrelevant or erroneous observations, as well as errors in the formatting of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> Remember that in the context of data science a *variable* models a feature of a case or observation. They are represented as columns in a rectangular dataset."

Or on the contrary, do you need to remove the record because the data is erroneous? Can you still keep the record and replace the faulty value with a default value, so you do not lose information relevant to other variables?
