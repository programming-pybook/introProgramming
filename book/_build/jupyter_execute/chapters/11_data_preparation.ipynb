    "In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) chapter, we mentioned the two main stages considered in a data science project. In this notebook, we will extend this workflow by adding a new stage, namely the *data preparation* stage. **Data preparation** is a critical stage within the data analysis process given that data should be structure in such a way that it eases the extraction of information and does not alter the expected results. It is required because there might be missing values, missing variables<sup>1</sup> that must be computed based on existing features, discrepancies in the levels of categorical variables, wrong data formats, erroneous observations, to name but a few. Thus, when analyzing data, we consider the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preparation:** raw data is manipulated and transformed so further analysis can be performed atop of it to solve a domain problem.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory data analysis:** assumptions are verified, methods are chosen, and quality hypotheses are formulated.\n",
    "3. **Confirmatory data analysis:** (statistical hypothesis testing) previously defined hypotheses are tested and conclusions are drawn from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we placed *data preparation* as the first stage of the data analysis process, it is common that after performing the EDA, data scientists go back to the underlying data and prepare it even further. This is natural after identifying irrelevant or erroneous observations, as well as errors in the formatting of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> Remember that in the context of data science a *variable* models a feature of a case or observation. They are represented as columns in a rectangular dataset."

Or on the contrary, do you need to remove the record because the data is erroneous? Can you still keep the record and replace the faulty value with a default value, so you do not lose information relevant to other variables?

During the last decades, we have witnessed the rise of international regulations–such as the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/))–that enforces certain security practices to protect the rights and privacy of people involved in data gathering studies. Therefore, sensitive data should be masked in your dataset. **Data masking** is the process of hiding data in the original dataset.

Some of the techniques used to pseudonymize data are:\n",

    "* **Schema integration:** you should be able to merge the schemas of the different data sources into one schema. \n",
    "* **Data conflicts:** conflicts can be related to *naming conflicts*, either by introducing synonyms (two variables with different names representing the same feature) or homonyms (two variables with the same name represent different features); *type conflicts*, where the same variable is modeled with a different data type in two sources, and; *domain conflicts*, where the same variable has a different domain in two sources, among others.\n",
    "* **Data redundancy:** merging multiple data sources might result in duplicated records or variables. In the former, the duplicated record might be expected if it is describing a different observation with the same attributes. However, the rationale behind keeping or removing a record must be clear. Having redundant information might negatively impact the readability and complexity of your data."
