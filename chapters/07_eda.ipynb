    "Probability theory saw its origins in gambling by the end of the 16$^{th}$ century. However, it was truly developed between the 17$^{th}$ and the 19$^{th}$ centuries. Mathematicians and gamblers used games of chance–such as the ones involving dice–to understand the extent to which a situation could happen. This is what we formally know as probability. In short, **probability** is the likelihood that an event will happen in the future or is true. This mathematical theory sets the foundations of **statistics** which is an applied science concerned with the modeling and analysis of data."

    "In this notebook, we will introduce the notion of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, an area of statistics that focuses on getting acquainted with the data at hand. It was promoted by John Tukey in his book \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" (1977), who mentioned the importance of first exploring the data to formulate better hypotheses later and assess previous assumptions. With the current computational power, EDA has gone far beyond expected, providing tools and resources to a variety of disciplines. With this mindset change, a data science project considers at least the following two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory data analysis:** assumptions are verified, methods are chosen, and quality hypotheses are formulated.\n",
    "2. **Confirmatory data analysis:** (also known as statistical hypothesis testing) previously defined hypotheses are tested and conclusions are drawn from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun fact:** John Tukey also coined the term \"bit\" in 1947, when developing statistical methods for computers when he was working for Bell Labs.\n",

However, if you want to know, $n-1$ is representing the **degrees of freedom** which is equivalent to the number of observations minus the number of parameters that you need to calculate to compute the measure. In this case, we have one parameter: the mean $\\overline{x}$. That is why we subtract one to $n$. And why do we need to do that?

For instance, the median is equivalent to the $50^{th}$ percentile, given that 50% of the values fall below that measure.
