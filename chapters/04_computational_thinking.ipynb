    "Finding the one definition of **Computational Thinking (CT)** is a task doomed to failure, mainly because it is hard to have a consensus on what CT means to everyone. To ease the communication and have a shared meaning, we consider CT as an approach to \"solve problems using computers as tools\" (Beecher, 2017). Notice that CT is not exclusively considered in computer science. On the contrary, CT impacts a wide range of subject areas such as mathematics, engineering, and science in general.\n",

Some people use them interchangeably, but the three terms are not equivalent. **Computer science** aims at building and understanding the principles of mathematical computation; while **programming**–which happens to be a subfield of computer science–focuses on high-quality program writing. Although the three terms are related and might intersect in many points, CT should be seen as a *method of problem-solving* that is frequently (but not exclusively) used in programming. In essence, problem-solving is a *creative* process.\n",

    "**Logic** is the study of the formal principles of reasoning. These principles determine what can be considered a correct or incorrect argument. An **argument** is \"a change of reasoning that ends up in a conclusion\" {cite}`Beecher`. Every statement within an argument is called a **proposition**, and it has a **truth value**. That is, it is either **true** or **false**. Thus, certain expressions like questions (e.g. \"are you hungry?\") or commands (e.g. \"clean your bedroom!\") cannot be propositions given that they do not have a truth value. \n",

    "\n",
    "This argument is composed of three propositions (each one is enumerated). These statements are propositions because all of them have a truth value. However, you can notice that some of these statements are used to arrive at a conclusion. The propositions that form the basis of an argument are known as **premises**. In our example, propositions 1 and 2 are premises. Lastly, the proposition that is derived from a set of premises is known as a **conclusion**."

    "### Types of Arguments\n",
    "Arguments can either be deductive or inductive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deductive Arguments\n",
    "**Deductive** arguments are considered a strong form of reasoning because the conclusion is derived from previous premises. However, deductive arguments can fail in two different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False premises:** One of the premises turns to be false. For example:\n",
    "    1. I eat healthy food.\n",
    "    2. Every person eating healthy food is tall.\n",
    "    3. I am tall.  \n",
    "    In this example, premise 2 is false. It is not true that every person eating healthy food is tall. Then, this argument fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Faulty logic:** The conclusion is wrongly derived out from the premises. For example:\n",
    "    1. All bitterballen are round.\n",
    "    2. The moon is round.\n",
    "    3. The moon is a bitterbal.  \n",
    "    In this case, the conclusion presented in premise 3 is false. It is true that bitterballen are round and that the moon is round, but this does not imply that the moon is a bitterbal! By the way, a \"bitterbal\" is a typical Dutch snack, to be eaten with a good glass of beer!\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Inductive Arguments\n",
    "Although deductive arguments are strong, they follow very stern standards that make them difficult to build. Additionally, the real world usually cannot be seen just in black and white–there are many shades in between. This is where inductive arguments play an important role. **Inductive** arguments do not have an unquestionable truth value. Instead, they deal with *probabilities* to express the level of confidence in them. Thus, the conclusion of the argument cannot be guaranteed to be true, but you can have a certain confidence in it. An example of an inductive argument comes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every time I go out home it is raining.\n",
    "2. Tomorrow I will go out from home.\n",
    "3. Tomorrow it will be raining.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way you can be certain that tomorrow will rain, but given the evidence, there is a high chance that it will be the case. (The chance might be even higher if we mention that we are living in the Netherlands!)"

To allow them to reason about the correctness of an argument, we use Boolean logic. **Boolean logic** is a form of logic that deals with deductive arguments–that is, arguments having propositions with a truth value that is either true or false. Boolean logic or Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole (that is why it is called Boolean) in his book \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\" in 1847. It deals with **binary variables** (with true or false values) representing propositions and logical operations on them. \n",

    "The main logical operators used in Boolean logic to connect propositions are:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use logic to solve everyday life problems. To do so, we rely on the so-called algorithms. Logic and algorithms are not equivalent. On the contrary, an algorithm uses logic to make decisions for it to solve a well-defined problem. In short, an **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that are used to provide a solution to a problem. According to this definition, it seems that algorithms are what we create, refine, and execute every single day of our lives, isn't it? Think for instance about the algorithm to dress up in the morning or the algorithm (or sequence of steps) that you follow to bake a cake or cook a specific recipe. Those are also algorithms that we have internalized and follow unconsciously.\n",

    "1. the **problem** to be solved or question to be answered. If you do not have a well-defined problem you might end up designing a very efficient but *useless* algorithm that does not solve the problem at hand. Thus, ensure you understand the problem before thinking about a solution;\n",
    "2. the **inputs** of the algorithm–that is, the data you require to compute the solution;\n",

    "Without having a clear picture of your problem, and the expected inputs and output to solve that problem, it will be unlikely that you will be able to come up with a proper algorithm. Furthermore, beware that for algorithms to be useful, they should **terminate** at some point (they cannot just run forever without providing a solution!) and output a correct result. An algorithm is **correct** if it outputs the right solution to every possible input. Proving this might be unfeasible, which is why testing your algorithm (maybe after implementing a program) is crucial."

Writing down an algorithm is of great importance given that you do not only guarantee that you can execute the algorithm in future opportunities, but you also provide a means to share the algorithm, so other people can benefit from what you designed. But to be able to *write down* the algorithm, we require an additional tool–that is, a language. In the previous example, we used English to describe our Appeltaart algorithm. However, if you remember correctly, computational thinking relies on computers to solve real-world problems. Thus, the algorithms we want to write down must be written in a language that can be understood by a computer. But beware! The computer is not the only other entity that needs to understand your algorithm: what you write down should be understood by both the machine and other people that might read it afterward (including the you from the future).\n",

    "Humans and computers are not able to completely grasp and understand the real world. Thus, to solve real-world problems, we usually need to create models that help us understand and solve the issue. A **model** is a representation of an entity. Thus, a model as a representation that, by definition, ignores certain details of the represented entity, is also a type of *abstraction*. A model in computer science usually consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entities:** core concepts of the represented system.\n",
    "* **Relationships:** connections among entities within the represented system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models usually come in two flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Static models:** these models reflect a snapshot of the system at a given moment in time. The state of the system might change in the future but the changes are so small or unfrequent that the model is still useful and sufficient.\n",
    "* **Dynamic models:** these models explain changes in the state of a system over time. They always involve *states* (description of the system at a given point in time) and *transitions* (state changes). Some dynamic models can be executed to predict the state of the system in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a model you should verify that:\n",
    "* The model is *useful* to solve the problem at hand.\n",
    "* You are strictly following the *rules*, notation, and conventions to define a model.\n",
    "* The level of *accuracy* of your model is acceptable to solve the problem (i.e. you keep the strictly needed information).\n",
    "* You have defined the level of *precision* at which you represent your model (especially when dealing with decimal numbers; how many decimal points are required?)."

    "In this section, we will apply computational thinking to solve a problem from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, written by Lewis Caroll. In chapter I, \"Down the Rabbit Hole\", Alice found herself falling down into a rabbit hole. She finally reached the ground, coming upon \"a heap of sticks and dry leaves\". Alice found herself in a \"long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\"There were doors all around the hall, but they were all locked\". She started \"wondering how she was ever to get out again\". She suddenly discovered a tiny golden key on a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass. After looking around, \"she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\" But she was not able to go through it; the doorway was too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the chapter, we find out that there was a bottle with a 'DRINK ME' label that makes shorter anyone drinking its content. There was also a very small cake with the words 'EAT ME' beautifully marked in currant. Anyone eating the cake will grow larger. **How can we help Alice go out of the hall through the small doorway behind the curtain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, assume that:\n",
    "* Alice is 60 inches tall;\n",
    "* Alice can go out of the doorway if she is taller than 10 inches (exclusive) and shorter than 15 inches (inclusive);\n",
    "* one sip of the 'DRINK ME' bottle makes anyone get 11 inches shorter;\n",
    "* Alice can only sip from the bottle at a point in time;\n",
    "* one bite of the 'EAT ME' cake makes anyone grow 1 inch larger;\n",
